# ATM Website Documentation

## Overview
The ATM (Agent Tool Manager) website serves as the front-facing platform for developers to discover, publish, and manage AI tools. It acts as a package registry similar to npm but tailored for AI tools. The website will feature a tool marketplace, user authentication, and integration with Synaptic for cloud-based execution.

## Key Features

### 1. **Homepage**
- Overview of ATM and its purpose.
- Call-to-action for users to explore tools or publish their own.
- Showcase featured/popular tools.

### 2. **Tool Discovery**
- Search bar with filters (by category, tags, popularity, date published).
- Tool listings with key metadata (name, description, author, version, tags).
- Tool detail page with:
  - Full description
  - Schema & execution details
  - Installation & execution instructions
  - User reviews & ratings

### 3. **Tool Publishing**
- Logged-in users can submit new tools.
- Upload or define:
  - `metadata.json` (name, version, description, author, etc.)
  - `schema.json` (defines input/output)
  - `execution.py` or `execution.js` (execution code)
- Versioning system to manage updates.

### 4. **User Authentication & Dashboard**
- Register/Login (via email, OAuth, or GitHub integration).
- Dashboard for managing published tools.
- API key management for CLI & Synaptic integration.

### 5. **Integration with Synaptic**
- Option to execute tools in the cloud via Synaptic.
- Display execution history/logs.
- Performance analytics for tool usage.

### 6. **Community & Documentation**
- User reviews and ratings for tools.
- Forums or discussion threads for tool feedback.
- Developer documentation on:
  - How to publish tools
  - How to integrate with Synaptic
  - API & CLI usage

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js / React
- **Backend**: Express.js / FastAPI (later integration with atm-registry)
- **Database**: MongoDB / PostgreSQL
- **Auth**: JWT, OAuth (GitHub, Google)
- **Deployment**: Vercel / AWS / Cloudflare Pages

## MVP Roadmap
1. **Build Static Pages with Mock Data**
2. **Implement User Authentication**
3. **Create Tool Discovery & Listing Pages**
4. **Add Publishing & Dashboard Features**
5. **Integrate ATM-Registry Backend**
6. **Implement Synaptic Execution Support**

## Next Steps
- Design wireframes for key pages.
- Set up frontend project with Next.js.
- Define API contract for tool listing & publishing.
